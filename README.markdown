#WARNING
This project is now deprecated. It was based on the AWS CloudFormation framework.

It added a Puppet Face to enable simple creation of a fully operational
Puppet Enterprise stack utilizing module content from the Puppet Forge.

This module is now obsolete.

Puppet now supports AWS CloudFormation templates with [puppet-cloudformation-templates](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-cloudformation-templates)

The Puppet Enterprise Master template resides at [master-template](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-cloudformation-templates/blob/master/templates/puppet_enterprise_monolithic_payg.template)
